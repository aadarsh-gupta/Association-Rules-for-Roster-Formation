How can you find the best combination of players within your squad to maximise the probability of a positive result against a
stubborn opponent?

Here, I make use of association rule mining to figure out the strongest links in wins and losses that have occured in the past 
results. We can combine this with further approaches like clustering to really single into the most desired objective we want to achieve in any kind of data. 

The analysis also involved multiple data formulations and tranformations to get at a required player-match granularity of data.

This apprach can be resued at many scenarios, while dealing with employee or team management projects.
